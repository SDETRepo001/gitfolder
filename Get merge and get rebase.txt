n Git there are 2 ways to integrate changes from one branch to another
git merge
git rebase

git merge
- Is a non-destructive operation
- Existing branches are not changed in any way
- Creates a new merge commit in the feature branch

git rebase
- Moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch
- Re-writes the project history
- We get much cleaner and linear project history
